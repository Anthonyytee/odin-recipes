        <heading>Ingredients</heading>
        <ul>
            <li>2 corn tortillas, preferably stale, or left out overnight to dry out a bit, quartered or cut into 6 wedges</li>
            <li>Corn oil, or other neutral oil for frying</li>
            <li>Kosher salt </li>
            <li>1 1/2 to 2 cups red chile sauce or salsa verde, store-bought or homemade (see end of recipe for homemade versions)</li>
            <li>Sprigs of epazote, optional</li>
        </ul>

        <heading>Steps</heading>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large saut√© pan, coat pan generously with corn oil, (1/8 inch), heat on medium high to high. 
                When the oil is quite hot, add the tortillas, fry until golden brown.

                Remove tortillas to a paper towel lined plate to soak up excess oil. Sprinkle a little salt on the tortillas.
                
                Wipe pan clean of any browned bits of tortillas.</li>
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons of oil to pan, bring to high heat again. Add the salsa and let salsa cook for several minutes. 
                If you have a few sprigs of epazote, add them to the salsa.</li>
            <li>Add the fried tortilla quarters to the salsa. Gently turn over the pieces of tortilla until they are all 
                well coated with salsa. Let cook for a few minutes more.

                Remove from heat. Serve chilaquiles with garnishes and fried eggs and beans or nopalitos.</li>

        </ol>
